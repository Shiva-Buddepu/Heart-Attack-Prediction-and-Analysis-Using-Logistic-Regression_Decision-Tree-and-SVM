# Heart Attack Prediction and Analysis Using Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, and SVM

## Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing and predicting the likelihood of a **heart attack** using the `heart.csv` dataset.  
It combines **data analysis**, **feature evaluation**, and **machine learning models** to identify critical factors influencing heart disease.

##  Data Preprocessing and Analysis
1. **Outlier Detection:** Identified and handled abnormal data points.  
2. **Duplicate Data Removal:** Ensured dataset integrity.  
3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**  
   - Distribution plots, pair plots, and correlation heatmaps.  
   - Insights on how each attribute affects heart disease risk.
4. **Multicollinearity Check:**  
   - Used **Variance Inflation Factor (VIF)** to detect correlated features.
5. **Feature Selection:**  
   - Applied **Pearson Correlation** to retain significant features.
  
## Model Development
Implemented and compared three supervised learning models:
- **Logistic Regression**
- **Decision Tree Classifier**
- **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**

## Model Evaluation
Evaluated each model using the following metrics:
- Confusion Matrix (with heatmap)
- Accuracy Score
- Precision, Recall, F1-Score
